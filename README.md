## Prerequisites

### General Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of Python
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks

### API Keys Required

- **Mistral AI**: Get from [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai)
- **OpenRouter** (Day 3 only): Get from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token_here
```

### Package Dependencies

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv requests beautifulsoup4 mistralai openai gradio torch transformers datasets huggingface-hub bitsandbytes accelerate
```

**Note:** Days 5-7 require running in Google Colab with GPU access.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Set up your environment variables** (create `.env` file)
3. **Start with Day 1** and progress sequentially
4. **For Days 5-7:** Use the "Open in Colab" button in each notebook

Each notebook is self-contained and includes:

- Clear section headers explaining each step
- Standalone code cells that can be run independently
- Sample output from previous executions
- Hands-on exercises and experiments

## Tips for Success

1. **Execute cells sequentially** - Each notebook builds on previous setup steps
2. **Experiment freely** - Modify prompts and inputs to see different behaviors
3. **Monitor API usage** - Days 1-4 make actual API calls (you may incur costs)
4. **Use GPU in Colab** - Enable GPU runtime for Days 5-7 for better performance
5. **Check outputs** - Each notebook includes example outputs to compare against

---

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**

- Verify `.env` file is in the root directory
- Check that API keys are valid and not expired
- Ensure environment variables are loaded with `load_dotenv()`

**Colab Issues (Days 5-7):**

- Enable GPU: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU
- Authenticate with HF token when prompted
- Ensure sufficient storage for model downloads

**Out of Memory:**

- Reduce batch sizes in sentiment analysis
- Run memory cleanup cells explicitly
- Use smaller quantized models
