🚀 **From API Calls to Model Deployment: My 8-Day LLM Engineering Journey**

Over the past few weeks, I've been diving deep into Large Language Model (LLM) engineering, and I wanted to share my learning path with you all. Whether you're just starting out or looking to level up your AI skills, here's what I've covered:

📘 **Day 1-2: Foundations**
Started with Mistral AI API integration, web scraping with BeautifulSoup, and building a website summarizer. Then moved to structured JSON responses for intelligent link extraction—prompt engineering at its finest!

📘 **Day 3-4: Building Real Applications**
Explored multi-provider workflows with Mistral and GPT-4 via OpenRouter. Created adversarial conversations between models (yes, they "debated" each other! 🤖). Then built interactive web UIs with Gradio for real-time streaming responses.

📘 **Day 5-6: Diving Into Transformers**
Used Hugging Face pipelines for sentiment analysis, NER, and Q&A systems. Mastered tokenization mechanics and chat templates—understanding how models actually "read" our prompts was a game-changer.

📘 **Day 7-8: Advanced Deployment**
Ran quantized models (Llama 3.2, Phi-4, Qwen 3, DeepSeek R1) locally with 4-bit quantization. Culminated with a code generation tool that ports Python to Rust/C++ and actually compiles and runs the output!

**Key Takeaways:**
✅ API integration across multiple providers
✅ Building production-ready UIs with Gradio
✅ Memory optimization through quantization
✅ Understanding tokenization for better prompts
✅ Practical code generation workflows

The entire journey is documented with hands-on Jupyter notebooks, perfect for learning by doing.
